This is a code originally from RITESH that I modified.

It allows to detect people (or whatever the .xml file given) on a camera stream and then to track it.

It uses a RealSense camera. If you don't have it, you just have to modify the code to give a mat image to the detector and the tracker. It can be another camera or a file.
