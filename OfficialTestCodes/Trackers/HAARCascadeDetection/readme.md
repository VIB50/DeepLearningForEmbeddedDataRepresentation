In this folder is my code to make HAAR cascade detection work.

It works with my RealSense camera. If you don't have, you just have to modify the code in order to give a mat image to the detector. It could be another camera or a file.

You will find 4 .xml files. Those are trained filez found online. If you wish to train yours, you can. Many great places teach how to do it.
